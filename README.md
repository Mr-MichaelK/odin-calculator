# odin-calculator

The aim of this project is to recap my HTML and CSS knowledge and to test my JS and DOM manipulation skills to construct a functional calculator that takes 2 operands at a time.

Development of this project will be done in three chunks:

1) Planning Phase: sketch out a design and brainstorm the functionality of the calculator program.
2) Design Phase: write the HTML and CSS of the webpage.
3) Coding Phase: write the JS code behind the functionality of the calculator.
